### General Info :anatomical_heart:	:anatomical_heart:		
***
Salow is a project with a social base. We have seen the need to make some medical services available to everyone, since we live in a time where not everyone can access basic care such as mental health or the possibility of seeing a chiropractor. So we have created a medical services guide where we appeal to health workers to offer their services at low cost to make health universal. The system works with a monthly payment that the health worker can cancel whenever he wants. Users do not have to pay to enter the web to see the services offered.
